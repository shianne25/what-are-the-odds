# NBA Data — API Reference

## Commands

### get_scoreboard
Get live/recent NBA scores.
- `date` (str, optional): Date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Defaults to today.

Returns `events[]` with game info, scores, status, and competitors.

### get_standings
Get NBA standings by conference.
- `season` (int, optional): Season year

Returns `groups[]` with Eastern/Western conferences and team standings including W-L, PCT, GB, streak, home/away/conference records, and PPG.

### get_teams
Get all 30 NBA teams. No parameters.

### get_team_schedule
Get schedule for a specific team.
- `team_id` (str, required): ESPN team ID
- `season` (int, optional): Season year
- `season_type` (str, optional): `regular`, `postseason` (alias `playoffs`), `playin`, `preseason`, or `all` (regular + play-in + playoffs). Omitted, ESPN returns the regular season only, so playoff and play-in games need `postseason`/`playin` or `all`.

Returns `events[]` with opponent, date, score (if played), and venue.

### get_game_summary
Get detailed box score and scoring plays.
- `event_id` (str, required): ESPN event ID

Returns `game_info`, `competitors`, `boxscore` (stats per player), `scoring_plays`, and `leaders`.

### get_leaders
Get NBA statistical leaders (points, rebounds, assists, etc.).
- `season` (int, optional): Season year

Returns `categories[]` with leader rankings per stat category.

### get_news
Get NBA news articles.
- `team_id` (str, optional): Filter by team

Returns `articles[]` with headline, description, published date, and link.

### get_win_probability
Get win probability chart data for a game.
- `event_id` (str, required): ESPN event ID

Returns timestamped home/away win probability percentages throughout the game.

### get_schedule
Get NBA games for a specific date.
- `date` (str, optional): Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `season` (int, optional): Not a filter: ESPN's scoreboard has none. With `date` it is ignored; alone it returns an error. For a season use `get_team_schedule(team_id, season)`.

Returns `events[]` for the specified date.

### get_injuries
Get current NBA injury reports across all teams. No parameters.

Returns `teams[]` with per-team injury lists including player name, position, status (Out/Doubtful/Questionable/Day-To-Day), injury type, and detail.

- `season_year` (int, optional): Season year. Defaults to current.

Returns `futures[]` with market name and entries (team/player name + odds value). Each market reports one provider: the group with usable entries and the lowest finite numeric priority. Numeric strings are accepted; missing/invalid priorities rank after numeric priorities, and ties use ESPN response order. `provider` is included only when the selected group has a name.

- `player_id` (str, required): ESPN athlete ID
- `season_year` (int, optional): Season year. Defaults to current.
- `season_type` (int, optional): 1=preseason, 2=regular (default), 3=postseason.

Returns `categories[]` with detailed stats including value, rank, and per-game averages.

### get_live_scoreboard
Get real-time NBA scores from NBA CDN, with ESPN as a fallback. No parameters.

Returns today's games with live status and scores.

### get_live_boxscore
Get a real-time NBA box score from NBA CDN, with ESPN as a fallback.
- `game_id` (str, required): NBA game ID, for example `0022400001`.

Returns game information and the current player box score. If cdn.nba.com fails
(it often answers HTTP 403), the NBA game id is mapped to its ESPN event id
(game date and teams from stats.nba.com, then the ESPN scoreboard for that date)
and the ESPN game summary is returned. If the mapping fails, the error says why
and names the ESPN command to call. `get_live_playbyplay` falls back the same way.

### get_live_playbyplay
Get real-time NBA play-by-play with the most recent plays first.
- `game_id` (str, required): NBA game ID.
- `limit` (int, optional): Maximum plays to return. Defaults to 25.
- `scoring_only` (bool, optional): Return only scoring plays. Defaults to false.

Returns recent play actions for the game.

### get_player_live_stats
Get real-time stats for one player in today's games.
- `player_name` (str, required): Full or partial player name.

Returns the matching player's current box-score line.

### get_nbastats_game_log
Get the league game log via the NBA Stats backend (stats.nba.com): one row per team per game, or per player per game.
- `season` (int or str, optional): Season starting year (`2024`) or NBA form (`"2024-25"`). Defaults to current.
- `team` (str, optional): Team abbreviation filter; ESPN spellings (`GS`, `NY`, `NO`, `SA`, `UTAH`, `WSH`) are translated.
- `season_type` (str, optional): `regular` (default), `playoffs`, `preseason`, or `playin`.
- `player_or_team` (str, optional): `team` (default) or `player`. `player` without `player` returns every player's games (about 26,000 rows a season); narrow it with `team` or the shaping params.
- `player` (str, optional): Player name or NBA person id (`"LeBron James"`, `"2544"`). Returns that player's games from `playergamelog`, a request of a few KB. Implies `player_or_team="player"`.
- `sort_by`, `descending`, `limit`, `fields` (optional): Row shaping, see SKILL.md.

Returns `games[]` with NBA.com's lowercased columns: `game_id`, `game_date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), `matchup` (`"LAL vs. HOU"` at home, `"LAL @ HOU"` away), `wl`, `min`, `pts`, `reb`, `ast`, `fg3m`, `plus_minus`, and the rest of the box line, plus `team_abbreviation` and `team_abbreviation_espn`. Player rows add `player_id`, `opponent` and `home_away` (`home`/`away`, parsed from `matchup`; `null` if it does not parse) (and `player_name`, `team_id`, `team_name`, `fantasy_pts` for league-wide player rows). With `player`, the response adds `player_id` and `player`. The default team log is unchanged.
