# ESPN Sport and League Slugs

Documented sport and league slugs for the ESPN API. Use these slugs in URL paths.

**Scope:** this file lists 106 league rows across 17 sport sections (cricket has no rows; its slugs come from discovery). It is not a complete list of what ESPN serves, and an entry here does not guarantee every endpoint works for that league. For anything not listed, use the discovery endpoints in [endpoints.md](endpoints.md#discovery-v2) (e.g. `https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/{sport}/leagues`).

Before using a slug, check whether a dedicated skill already covers that league (see the Routing table in `SKILL.md`).

## How Slugs Work

ESPN endpoints require two slugs: a **sport** slug and a **league** slug.

- **Site API pattern:** `.../sports/{sport}/{league}/...`
- **Core API pattern:** `.../sports/{sport}/leagues/{league}/...`
