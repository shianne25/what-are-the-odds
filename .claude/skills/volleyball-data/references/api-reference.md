All data comes from the Nevobo (Nederlandse Volleybalbond) open API at `https://api.nevobo.nl`. No authentication required.

Two interfaces are used:
- **JSON-LD / Hydra**: Paginated collections for competitions, poules, clubs
- **RSS Export**: Per-poule standings, schedules, results; per-club feeds

## Volleyball Scoring

- Set scores appear as e.g. "25-21, 25-18, 21-25, 25-20"
- Match result appears as e.g. "3-1" (sets won by each team)
- Points: 3 for a 3-0 or 3-1 win, 2 for a 3-2 win, 1 for a 2-3 loss, 0 otherwise
