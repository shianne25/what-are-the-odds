```json
{
  "timeline": [
    {
      "play_id": "4018644942",
      "home_win_pct": 59.0,
      "tie_pct": 0.0
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}

If ESPN returns no summary for the event, the command returns an error with `No data found for event <event_id>`. If the summary has no win probability entries, it returns an error with `No win probability data available for this game` rather than an empty timeline.
